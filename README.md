# Multifrequency-TENS-Unit
Team designed a multifrequency TENS unit from scratch using integrated circuits and assembled it on a PCB, so as to integrate therapy for pain, occurring at different parts of the body, into one device. Went through stages such as research, circuit design, simulation, breadboard implementation, and finally to PCB design. Published thesis for final year major project.
